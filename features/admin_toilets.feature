Feature: Administering toilets
  As an administrator
  I want and overview of all toilets and the ability to edit their data
  So that I know what toilets are available and to keep the data up-to-date

  Background:
    Given the following toilets exist:
    | name      | address   | venuetype  | toiletlocation | whocanuse | howtoaccess  | changingbench | hoist | description | long  | lat  | opening_time | closing_time |
    | toilet 02 | address 2 | venue 2    | location 2     | use 2     | access 2     | true          | false | desc 2      | 52.00 | 0.02 | 09:30        | 16:45        |
    | toilet 03 | address 3 | venue 3    | location 3     | use 3     | access 3     | false         | true  | desc 3      | 53.00 | 0.03 | 12:20        | 22:30        |
